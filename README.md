# Media Design Practices - Creative Technology I
## Behavior in Motion

---
** Design Brief **
Create an interactive piece that uses one or more servo motors to create something that feels alive. It must be based on research inspiration, where you find an example of something alive that behaves through movement.

This project builds on the previous emotion project ideas. But in this project, the physical movement provides the primary mode of expression. The expressive movement can indicate more than emotion, and can be functional (like looking up), or communicative (like shaking left/right to indicate “no”).

This project needs a strong concept as well as thoughtful design and form making – it is not only about technology. Having wires hanging out all over is not acceptable – you must create an enclosure. In other words, the project should feel finished and refined.

** Requirements ** 
- Have more than one type of movement (this creates a much greater sense of life)
- The servo must be attached to something that it moves
- The movement must be altered based on input from a sensor(s)
- Avoid literal human faces
- Use more than one sensor and/or more than one servo
